# ============================================================================
# Version Registry — infrastructure-level, independent of application code.
#
# This file lives in the platform repo, NOT in any app repo.
# It tracks the current and last-released version for every app
# across all stacks. Think of it as the "known good version set".
#
# How it's used:
#   - The pipeline reads this as the DEFAULT version set.
#   - You can OVERRIDE any version at run time by passing a
#     version-overrides parameter (JSON) to the pipeline.
#   - On PR pass:  the RC suffix auto-increments here.
#   - On merge:    the version promotes to release, the image gets
#                  tagged with that semver, and patch bumps for next cycle.
#
# Manual edits are expected for major/minor bumps:
#   change 1.2.1-rc.0 → 2.0.0-rc.0 to signal a breaking change.
